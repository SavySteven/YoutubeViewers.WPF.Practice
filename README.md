# YouTube Viewers WPF Practice

A **WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)** desktop application built with **C# .NET**, following the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architectural pattern. This practice project appears to be a management system for "YouTube Viewers" (likely tracking subscribers, viewers, or related entities in a YouTube channel context).

The clean folder structure with separate directories for Commands, Components, Stores, ViewModels, and Views indicates a well-organized MVVM implementation, ideal for learning modern WPF development practices.

## Features (Inferred from Structure)

- MVVM Pattern Implementation
- Reactive or asynchronous commands (via `Commands` folder)
- Reusable UI components (`Components`)
- State management (`Stores`)
- Separation of concerns with dedicated `ViewModels` and `Views`
